# DataMining-PortfolioOptimization

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE: 
Objective:
Construct a portfolio that minimizes risk (e.g., low volatility or low Value-at-Risk) through diversification. Diversification will be upheld through using data from groupings of stocks ranging across the top 12 industries. 


Scope:
- Use a diversified set of stocks spanning multiple industries.
- Decide on a historical window (e.g., 5 years) that balances recency with data stability. (potentially Compare it with a different dataset (3 years but daily data))
- Determine whether you want to include all stocks or apply screening criteria (e.g., liquidity, data completeness).
